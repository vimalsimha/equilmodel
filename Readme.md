Equilibrium Model of Galaxy Formation
================

The Equilibrium Model of Galaxy Formation is a semi-analytic model of Galaxy Formation based on the assumption that galaxies grow along a slowly-evolving equilibrium between gas accretion, star formaton and feedback.

Code and Instructions
---------------------

-   The code takes in input parameters, including the halo mass and generates the growth history of a galaxy including the evolution of its star formation rate, metallicity and gas fraction in a file called *outputs.txt*

-   **equilfuncs.R** contains functions required for running the equilibrum model.

-   **equilcode.R** is the code for running the equilibrium model.

-   Download both .R files into the same directory.

-   The model parameters in equilcode.R can be fitted to data if desired.

-   The basic parameters in equilcode.R may be modified if desired.
